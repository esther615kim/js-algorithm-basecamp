#### Stack in JS
-Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
-real-world example is a stack of plates
-a linear data structure (arranged in a sequential order,operations can ahppen at 1 end)

##### fundamental operations
1.push—This operation is responsible for inserting or pushing a new element to the stack.
2.pop—This operation is responsible for removing the most recent element from the stack.


```
class Stack {
 constructor() {
   this.stack = [];
 }
 push(item) {
   this.stack.push(item);
 }
 pop() {
   this.stack.pop();
 }
}
```

#### Queue
-works based on the principle of first in first out (FIFO)
-a linear data structure(operations can ahppen at 1 end, beginning of the queue)

##### fundamental operations
1.enqueue—inserting or pushing a new element to the queue.
2.dequeue—removing the oldest element from the queue.

```
let stack = [];
const enqueue = (item) => queue.push(item);
const dequeue = () => queue.shift();
```
