#### Greedy
The greedy algorithm says that you repeatedly look for the largest coin less than or equal to the remaining amount of money, then subtract that coin from the remaining amount. When the remaining amount reaches zero (or less), return the counts of coins used. (This algorithm is not always optimal.)
